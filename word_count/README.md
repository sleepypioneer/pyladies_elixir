# Pyladies.WordCount

Our plan is to write an implementation to `word_count` that well will count all words (only words :) ) and return final value.

## How to start

- Clone this repository
- Assuming that you have `elixir` installed
- Open `word_count` folder using your favorite editor or IDE
- Explore and do not hesitate to ask any question or guidance :)
- Before doing changes it is a good practice to try to compile project using `mix compile`
- As there are some dependencies start with `mix deps.get`
- There are tests so lets check if they are working `mix test`
- Now lets do changes...

It is good to spend some time to experiment and trying to find a solution but when you feel you need help just ask :)
